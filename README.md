Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or macOS** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 2.3.1 or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

### Developing Locally

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Clone *your forked repository* (not our original one) to your hard drive with `git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/slate.git`
3. `cd slate`
4. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).

### Deploying to S3

1. Ensure you have AWS staging access to S3.  If you don't, speak with @neto
2. Compile your changes into static files using the command `bundle exec middleman build --clean`
3. Copy your static files to S3, using the command `aws s3 sync ./build s3://public-docs.procurify-staging.com/integrations`
