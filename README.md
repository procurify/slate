Getting Started with Slate
------------------------------

### Prerequisites

You're going to need:

 - **Linux or macOS** — Windows may work, but is unsupported.
 - **Ruby, version 3.1.0p or newer**
 - **Bundler** — If Ruby is already installed, but the `bundle` command doesn't work, just run `gem install bundler` in a terminal.

If you are on an M1 machine, you may experience problems installing `ruby`, please following this guide here
https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/?utm_source=stackoverflow&utm_campaign=51126403

### Developing Locally

1. Clone this repo at `https://github.com/procurify/sticky.git`
2. `cd slate`
3. Initialize and start Slate. You can either do this locally, or with Vagrant:

```shell
# either run this to run locally
bundle install
bundle exec middleman server

# OR run this to run with vagrant
vagrant up
```

You can now see the docs at http://localhost:4567. Whoa! That was fast!

Now that Slate is all set up on your machine, you'll probably want to learn more about [editing Slate markdown](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Markdown-Syntax), or [how to publish your docs](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate).

If you'd prefer to use Docker, instructions are available [in the wiki](https://github.com/lord/slate/wiki/Docker).

### Deploying to Github Pages

A deploy script comes bundled with the repo, just follow [these steps here in the official wiki](https://github.com/slatedocs/slate/wiki/Deploying-Slate) to deploy to https://procurify.github.io/sticky/#netsuite.
